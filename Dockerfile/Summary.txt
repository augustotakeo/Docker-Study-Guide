ARG: Instruction used to define a variable that users can pass at build-time to the builder 
with the docker build command using the --build-arg <varname>=<value> flag. The variable is 
valid only in the build stage itâ€™s defined in, and prior use of the variable before it is 
defined results in an empty string.

ENV: Instruction is used to define an environment variable that will be available for all 
subsequent instructions in the build stage. This variable is persisted in containers created 
from the image built using this instruction. Its value can be changed at runtime using the 
env option with docker run. If the variable is only needed during build, and not in the final 
image, you can set the value of this variable in a single command or use the ARG instruction.
